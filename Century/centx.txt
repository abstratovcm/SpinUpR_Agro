   Notes:
     Specifying a command file input immediately
         stops argument processing. Command
         files can be chained.
     The a, e, and i arguments invoke extend
         options which allow linked runs
     The default output file is a binary file
         with the same root name as the event
         file but with the .bin extension.
     Default output will overwrite existing data
