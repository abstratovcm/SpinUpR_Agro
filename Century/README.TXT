    WHAT'S NEW

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:
---------------------
     o IBM Compatible PC.
     o MS Windows 95, NT 4 (SP#4), or later versions of Windows.
     o COMCTL32.DLL 4.70 or later (can be downloaded from
       http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q186/1/76.ASP).
     o 3MB free disk space.

INSTALLATION:
-------------
    To install TextPad from a file downloaded from the Internet, run
    the self-extracting executable file using Explorer or File Manager,
    and follow the on-screen instructions.

    To install TextPad, from diskettes, run SETUP.EXE from the diskette
    labelled "TextPad Setup Disk 1", and follow the on-screen
    instructions.

    See "Installing TextPad", in the on-line help, for more information.

    Upgrading from TextPad 3.x:
    ---------------------------
    File names in TextPad 4 are associated with document classes,
    using wild cards, and each class can have different properties, such
    as tab stops, font and syntax highlighting.  The way such properties
    are defined and saved has been completely redesigned, so no personal
    preferences are automatically transferred from TextPad 3.x.

    It is safe to install TextPad 4 in the same folder as version 3.x,
    but if you subsequently uninstall the earlier release, macros and
    clip libraries will be deleted from the SAMPLES subfolder, if they
    have the same name.  For this reason, we recommend installing
    TextPad 4 in a different folder, and then uninstalling TextPad 3.x
    after you have manually transferred your personal preferences,
    macros and clip libraries.

    For more information, please see "Installing TextPad" in the on-line
    help.
